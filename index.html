    <a name="ingredients"/><h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p> If you're interested in high quality, "ethical" eggs, look specifically for eggs from pastured raised chickens. This means the hens were given free access to the outdoors. Cage-free eggs are a good start, but they can still be housed in crowded farm buildings. Pastured raised are definitely more expensive, but may be worth if you're interested in higher quality eggs and animal welfare.</p>

        <li>3 eggs per person</li>

    <a name="directions"/><h4>Directions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs. With a fork, quickly stir the eggs until the yolks are broken and they are uniform yellow.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Melt butter or heat oil in your pan.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs over low to medium-low heat. The gentler your heat, the better. The best eggs will be cooked slowly over low heat to prevent overheating.</li>
        <li>Stir the eggs frequently to ensure they are cooked evenly.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring. Keep the eggs moving so the heat is evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs have reached your desired level of doneness, serve immediately with cheese, creme freche, hot sauce, or plain.</li>
